# Custom Rules Test

Let's test a different pattern that won't conflict with Astro's smart typography.

## Test Pattern: ==>

These arrows ==> should be replaced.

Multiple: ==> ==> ==>

In context: Click here ==> then go there ==> done!

## Code blocks should be preserved

```javascript
// This should NOT be replaced
const arrow = '==>';
```

## Test SUCCESS if you see:

If the custom rule is added and working, the ==> patterns above should be replaced with something else!
